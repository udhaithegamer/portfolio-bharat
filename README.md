# portfolio-bharat

This project showcases a Portfolio webpage created using HTML and CSS.
It's part of my First task as an intern at Bharat. The webpage mimics
the professional platform, providing a visually appealing user interface.
You can explore this project to learn about web development, design, and
layout techniques. Feel free to check out the code on GitHub and see how 
it was built step by step. Happy coding!
